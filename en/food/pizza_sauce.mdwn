# Ingredients

* XXX tomatoes; best to get a mix of sauce, diced, and skinned; depending on preference. Personally, I like things to be on the chunky side
* XXX olive oil
* XXX salt
* XXX spices; it's easiest to get ready-mixed spices
  * extra oregano

# Preparation

Mix it all, let simmer at low heat in an open pot, stir every few minutes. 30m of simmering are OK, 60m are better.
