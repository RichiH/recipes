# Abstract

Take the time to make this properly.
Let the sauce simmer for at least 30m or don't bother doing this at all.

* Feeds: 4
* Time for prep: 5m
* Total time: 60m
* Suggested variance: Follow this recipe somewhat closely the first time you cook this.
Next time, start playing around with spices you like or think would not be too horrible.
Sauce is generally a good place to start experimenting.
If in doubt, toss in more oregano.

# Ingredients

* XXX tomatoes; best to get a mix of sauce, diced, and skinned; depending on preference. Personally, I like things to be on the chunky side
* XXX olive oil
* XXX salt
* XXX spices; it's easiest to get ready-mixed spices
  * extra oregano

# Preparation

Mix it all, let simmer at low heat in an open pot, stir every few minutes. 30m of simmering are OK, 60m are better.
